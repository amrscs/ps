Economics PhD Thesis
====================

This is a **static** copy of the code used in my PhD thesis. 

Contains
--------
  - Python Code used to undertake analysis, generate plots and tables, and constructs datasets from raw data files.
  - Some additional data tables that are not contained in the printed version of the thesis.
  - a static copy of ``pyeconlab``. This is a python package that I built to support this work.

Notes
-----
1. Any further development of the python code will occur in the ``pyeconlab`` repository.
